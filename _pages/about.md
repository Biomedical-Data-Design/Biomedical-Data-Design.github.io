### Credits

The 4xx and 6xx course will provide 4 design-credits both semesters. 
The 2xx level is 3 credits both semesters.

### Course Requirements

Admittance to this course requires approval from the instructor, to ensure the students in the course are sufficient diverse along a number of dimensions. To gain admittance, you must:

1. Be more excited about this course than any other academic endeavor for the year. Nobody is required to teach or take this course, and since so many people want to take it each year, preference is given to those that are most passionate about the material.
2. In practice, people commonly spend up to 20 hrs per week in this class, or more.  It is often rated one of the most challenging courses, so please consider that when making your course schedule. Priority will be given to students that certainly have room to be successful in the course.
3. For the 4xx and 6xx class, some background in numerical programming is required.
4. Because this course is based on team projects, entire teams are approved all at once. You can join the course slack channel here to chat with other potential team mates.
5. Send the CV and transcript of all members of your planned team to me for joint approval.


### Background

This course is based on my experience as an academic, and entrepreneur, an advisor, and an instructor. It is designed to be the best class you'll ever take. You will learn (by doing and getting feedback) the skills that I have found particularly useful in my endeavors. It will be organized into weekly sprints. Weekly progress will be reported documenting goals towards your team sprints, with sprint demo's to happen at the close of each sprint. Each team will be graded jointly on the basis of meeting the sprint goals, as well as providing clear and concise weekly progress reports.

The main "skills" you will learn in this class include:

- How to choose a project *significant* for the world, *feasible* for you, and that you are intrinsically motivated to complete (see [https://bitsandbrains.io/2018/08/31/sig-and-feas.html]).
- How to scope work so that you can achieve weekly progress towards quarterly goals (see [https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/smart-goals.htm]).
- How to effectively communicate technical content.
- How to generate publication quality figures (see [figure checklist](https://bitsandbrains.io/2018/09/08/figures.html)).
- How to complete a wide set of data science tasks, spanning from data wrangling to statistical modeling.
- How to peacefully and productively work with a diverse team of passionate individuals.

### Course Summary

NDD is a year long project-based course where students work in teams of four to eight
students.  I offer three different levels,   2xx,  4xx, and 6xx.  The 2xx ensures that
people with limited to no background in data science and/or engineering can still 
participate and benefit from the course (3 credits both semesters).  The 4xx is designed
for undergraduates with background in engineering and data science.  The 6xx is designed
for more advanced undergraduates and graduate students (the 4xx and 6xx are 4 credits in 
the fall, and 6 credits in the spring, as of this year). Teams are encouraged to include 
students at all levels, as each level brings a unique and valuable perspective.  The 
goal of the course is to create an inspirational environment in which each of the 
students works on a team to build a data science product ``soup to nuts’‘, starting with 
ideation and ending with publication. Along the way, students learn skills that will 
serve them well in industry, academia, or government.  To facilitate these goals, the 
course is  divided into quarters:

### Course structure

- **Quarter 1 (first month of class)** The first month of class is devoted to _self-understanding_. Specifically, the students are required to form teams, and choose a project.  The choice of project is jointly driven by: (i) significance, (ii) feasibility, and (iii) intrinsic motivation.  We propose a number of existing brain science challenge problems and state-of-the-art datasets. Each team is required to choose a dataset, problem, and approach to solve it in this month.  We provide (at least) weekly feedback to help guide the teams to choosing signficant projects that are feasible for them that they are intrinsically motivated to solve.  At the end of the month, each team is required to submit  a two-page _research proposal_ describing their plan for the year, including (1) a neurobiological question to investigate for the year, and (2) a computational approach to solving it.  In addition, each individual student must identify a _github issue_ in a widely used open-source repository that they will resolve as part of their final project for the fall semester.  Specifically, this will consist of making a _pull request_ (PR) to one of the approved repositories, and getting that pull request approved and merged.  The PR can be as simple as updating documentation, fixing a bug, or as complex as contributing a new algorithm.
- **Quarter 2 (rest of fall semester)** This quarter is devoted to learning _basic data science skills_.  The deliverables include (1) for each individual,  a link to a merged PR  made to a widely used open source repository, (2) a link to an online document with the title and abstract  for a manuscript you plan to complete in the spring, (3) a link to an electronic notebook---including both code and text---demonstrating functionality of the analysis (pipeline) for your manuscript.
- **Quarter 3 (spring semester until spring break)** This quarter is devoted to _applying basic data science knowledge_.  The deliverables include (1) for each individual, a link to a PR of a newly developed method into one of the approved repositories, and (2) a link to an overleaf draft completing up to step 7 of paper writing for the team.
- **Quarter 4 (spring break until final)** This quarter is devoted to technically communicating and knowledge transfer. The deliverables include (1) for each individual, a link showing that the PR was merged in, (2) an email forwarded demonstrating that the manuscript was completed and submitted.

We have class three times per week.  About once per week I provide a lecture on some relevant data science content, typically content not available otherwise online.  The bulk of the classroom time, however, is spent with student presentations.  Each week each student presents their progress from the previous week, and their plan for the next week.  Feedback is provided in written form to each student for each presentation, and verbal feedback is provided whenever it seems generally useful for other students.  Each team also meets at least once more per week to prepare their presentation, and work together.  So far, the students have determined that the class is quite good, with an average overall quality of 4.71, as compared to the department’s average of 3.95, and the schools average of 4.09 (see Table 1 for details).  This is despite the fact that course is also typically ranked one of the most difficult and time-consuming courses.

Quantitative teaching evaluations for all NeuroData Design courses is shown below. Numbers represent ``overall quality’' of the course. Scores out of 5 (4 = “good”; 5 = “excellent”). Response rates: All but 2 students ever responded. The mean number of students is per semester (ignoring winter session and joining across multiple course levels if they met during the same time.  Note that course evaluations for several course numbers are not available online, including 638.SP18 and 497.FA18.
