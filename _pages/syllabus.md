### Credits

The 4xx and 6xx course will provide 4 design-credits both semesters. 
The 2xx level is 3 credits both semesters.

### Course Requirements

Admittance to this course requires approval from the instructor, to ensure the students in the course are sufficient diverse along a number of dimensions. To gain admittance, you must:

1. Be more excited about this course than any other academic endeavor for the year. Nobody is required to teach or take this course, and since so many people want to take it each year, preference is given to those that are most passionate about the material.
2. In practice, people commonly spend up to 20 hrs per week in this class, or more.  It is often rated one of the most challenging courses, so please consider that when making your course schedule. Priority will be given to students that certainly have room to be successful in the course.
3. For the 4xx and 6xx class, some background in numerical programming is required.
4. Because this course is based on team projects, entire teams are approved all at once. You can join the course slack channel here to chat with other potential team mates.
5. Send the CV and transcript of all members of your planned team to me for joint approval.


### Background

This course is based on my experience as an academic, and entrepreneur, an advisor, and an instructor. It is designed to be the best class you'll ever take. You will learn (by doing and getting feedback) the skills that I have found particularly useful in my endeavors. It will be organized into weekly sprints. Weekly progress will be reported documenting goals towards your team sprints, with sprint demo's to happen at the close of each sprint. Each team will be graded jointly on the basis of meeting the sprint goals, as well as providing clear and concise weekly progress reports.

The main "skills" you will learn in this class include:

- How to choose a project *significant* for the world, *feasible* for you, and that you are intrinsically motivated to complete (see [my blog post](https://bitsandbrains.io/2018/08/31/sig-and-feas.html)).
- How to scope work so that you can achieve weekly progress towards quarterly goals (see [smart goals](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/smart-goals.htm)).
- How to effectively communicate technical content.
- How to generate publication quality figures (see [figure checklist](https://bitsandbrains.io/2018/09/08/figures.html)).
- How to complete a wide set of data science tasks, spanning from data wrangling to statistical modeling.
- How to peacefully and productively work with a diverse team of passionate individuals.

### Course Summary

NDD is a year long project-based course where students work in teams of four to eight
students.  I offer three different levels,   2xx,  4xx, and 6xx.  The 2xx ensures that
people with limited to no background in data science and/or engineering can still 
participate and benefit from the course (3 credits both semesters).  The 4xx is designed
for undergraduates with background in engineering and data science.  The 6xx is designed
for more advanced undergraduates and graduate students (the 4xx and 6xx are 4 credits in 
the fall, and 6 credits in the spring, as of this year). Teams are encouraged to include 
students at all levels, as each level brings a unique and valuable perspective.  The 
goal of the course is to create an inspirational environment in which each of the 
students works on a team to build a data science product ``soup to nuts’‘, starting with 
ideation and ending with publication. Along the way, students learn skills that will 
serve them well in industry, academia, or government.  To facilitate these goals, the 
course is  divided into quarters:

### Course structure

- **Quarter 1 (first month of class)** The first month of class is devoted to _self-understanding_. Specifically, the students are required to form teams, and choose a project.  The choice of project is jointly driven by: (i) significance, (ii) feasibility, and (iii) intrinsic motivation.  We propose a number of existing brain science challenge problems and state-of-the-art datasets. Each team is required to choose a dataset, problem, and approach to solve it in this month.  We provide (at least) weekly feedback to help guide the teams to choosing signficant projects that are feasible for them that they are intrinsically motivated to solve.   
- **Quarter 2 (rest of fall semester)** This quarter is devoted to learning _basic data science skills_.  You will implement or fix some algorithm, or demonstrate its capabilities and limiations. 
- **Quarter 3 (spring semester until spring break)** This quarter is devoted to _applying basic data science knowledge_.  
- **Quarter 4 (spring break until final)** This quarter is devoted to *technically communicating* and knowledge transfer.

We have class three times per week.  About once per week I provide a lecture on some relevant data science content, typically content not available otherwise online.  The bulk of the classroom time, however, is spent with student presentations.  Each week each student presents their progress from the previous week, and their plan for the next week.  Feedback is provided in written form to each student for each presentation, and verbal feedback is provided whenever it seems generally useful for other students.  Each team also meets at least once more per week to prepare their presentation, and work together.  So far, the students have determined that the class is quite good, with an average overall quality of 4.71, as compared to the department’s average of 3.95, and the schools average of 4.09 (see Table 1 for details).  This is despite the fact that course is also typically ranked one of the most difficult and time-consuming courses.

Quantitative teaching evaluations for all NeuroData Design courses is shown below. Numbers represent ``overall quality’' of the course. Scores out of 5 (4 = “good”; 5 = “excellent”). Response rates: All but 2 students ever responded. The mean number of students is per semester (ignoring winter session and joining across multiple course levels if they met during the same time.  Note that course evaluations for several course numbers are not available online, including 638.SP18 and 497.FA18.

### Open Source Projects

The set of approved open-source repositories to contribute to include:

- [scipy](https://www.scipy.org/scipylib/index.html)
- [sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [networkx](https://networkx.github.io/)
- [skimage](https://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/api/skimage.html)
- [dipy](https://dipy.org/)

### Datasets

This course requires some analysis of data, the only approved dataset is the 
 [https://healthybrainnetwork.org/](Healthy Brain Network).  If for some reason you believe your tool cannot be applied to these data, please discuss with the TA.


### Communication

This class communicates largely in Slack. Please join our Slack channel at http://spiralscience.slack.com/signup to get involved. Regular updates are provided in Slack, and the instructors will assume you have received them. TA will answer questions from slack approximately within 48 hours.

### External Help

Jovo and TA are typically available after class and through Slack to provide feedback/guidance as requested.

### Grading

In general, it is expected that all students will be most excited about this class, and therefore invest a minimum of 12 hours of effort per week in the fall, and over 20 hours of effort per week in the spring. Assuming you at least convince jovo and TAs of this level of effort, and address their weekly feedback, you should expect an A. Anybody in danger of not receiving an A will be told so by jovo, and given clear requirements in order to bring your grade back up to an A. Anybody not receiving an A in the first semester will not be invited back for the second semester.

#### Weekly

Each week students will be graded on the degree of completion of their deliverables, typically including both a qualitative and quantitative result. After your presentations, instructors will provide detailed feedback on your slides, with instructions on how to improve them. Grades will be provided on the basis of your ability to complete the tasks you set out to perform, and update slides on the basis of other's input. In addition, slides should have research artifacts for each task (whether completed or not).

#### Sprint Deliverable Grades

The sprint deliverables will be graded as follows. Jovo will send a link to your webpage to a technically competent student or collaborator, as well as instructions. That person will attempt to run the tool from start to finish. If she is unable to complete the analysis, you get a zero. If she is able to complete it, but gets results dramatically different from what she should have gotten, you get a 50%. If she is able to complete it, and gets answers that are reasonable, you get a 100%.

### Feedback

Steven Covey, author of "Seven Habits", states that the 7th habit is "sharpening our sword", which means (for this class), getting feedback and seriously considering it. Every person involved in the class will therefore be required to provide feedback to others, including the instructor. Students will also identify properties of the class which gruntle or disgruntle them, so that we may make adjustments.
