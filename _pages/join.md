If you would like to take Neuro Data Design Fall 2020, please follow all of the steps below: 

1. Read the [syllabus](https://neurodatadesign.github.io/syllabus/). Make sure that the course sounds right for you. If you are unsure, we recommend having a look at some of the [publications](https://neurodatadesign.github.io/publications/) that have resulted from the course, or talking to current students (you can get in touch via Slack, see below). 

2. Consider prerequisites. In the past, we have found the most essential skill to be programming (Python experience is particularly helpful). The course is very self-directed and the instructors will not be giving extensive instruction on programming, though programming will be required of everyone, so we expect students to have these skill before joining.

3. Join the [Slack](https://spiralscience.slack.com/signup) workspace. Once you join the workspace, also make sure to join the #ndd-20-21 channel. This is where we will discuss all course logistics and organize into teams for next year.

4. Find a team.
