If you would like to take Neuro Data Design Fall 2020, please follow all of the steps below: 

1. **Read the [syllabus](https://neurodatadesign.github.io/syllabus/).** Make sure that the course sounds right for you. If you are unsure, look at some of the [publications](https://neurodatadesign.github.io/publications/) written by students who previously took the course, or talk to current students (you can get in touch via Slack, see below). 

2. **Consider the prerequisites.** Programming is an essential skill that will be required of everyone. Specifically, students will extensively use *Python* and *GitHub*. This course will move quickly into developing data science tools and the instructors will not be giving extensive instruction on programming. We expect students to have these skills before joining.<br/><br/>
To demonstrate your understanding of *Python* and *GitHub*, please do *one* of the following:
    1. Send us proof of completion for these courses: [First Day on GitHub](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/paths/first-day-on-github) and [DataCamp Python Course](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science)
    2. Send us a link one of your GitHub repositories where you use Python. Make sure the repository demonstrates understanding commensurate with completion of the courses above.

3. **Join the [Slack](https://spiralscience.slack.com/signup) workspace.** Once you join the workspace, also make sure to join the **#ndd-20-21** channel. This is where we will discuss all course logistics and organize into teams for next year.

4. **Submit the [application form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScUUZyzke1GoNCEt-SUpiTU-CAmO1FEU1KAcrFCyILfI37NJw/viewform?usp=sf_link).**
